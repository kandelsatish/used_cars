## Project Description
The automotive industry, particularly the used car market, is a dynamic and competitive domain. In India, for instance, the used automobile market is predicted to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.12% from 2020 to 2025. With approximately 40 million used vehicles sold annually, effective pricing strategies are crucial for both companies and individuals to efficiently sell their products in a competitive market and make a profit. The Used Car Price Prediction Model is a machine learning project aimed at accurately predicting the price of used cars based on various factors such as mileage, make, model, year, colour and location. This project is motivated by the need for both sellers and buyers to make informed decisions about the price of used cars, given the many factors that influence a car's worth on the market.

## Problem Statement
Let’s consider purchasing a second-hand automobile. When looking for a certain model and year, you may come across an advertisement for the ideal vehicle. You're unclear if the asking price is realistic. Comparing the costs of identical automobiles may be time-consuming and inefficient. We propose software that uses basic car information to produce an acceptable asking price based on prior sales.
This project proposes a method that allows users to input basic information about a specific vehicle into a program that generates a reasonable asking price based on previous sales. The project's target consumers are those who purchase or sell used cars. A more open and efficient pricing structure will help both buyers and sellers of used cars. This would allow buyers to determine if an asking price is above average, below average, or fair, while sellers can easily determine a reasonable asking price for their vehicles. The project addresses the challenge of identifying the most 2 important factors in the price prediction model, which helps both parties better understand the reasoning behind the current value of their vehicles.

## Project Outcomes
- Informed Buying and Selling: Helps consumers make informed decisions when buying or selling used cars.
- Price Transparency: Promotes transparency by showing how various factors affect car prices.
- Fair Pricing: Facilitates fair pricing in the used car market for both buyers and sellers.
- Time and Effort Savings: Saves time and effort by automating the price estimation process.
- Reduced Information Asymmetry: Reduces information gaps between buyers and sellers.
- Market Insights: Provides insights into market trends for dealerships and the automotive industry.
- Enhanced User Experience: Offers a user-friendly tool for estimating car prices.
- User Feedback and Improvement: Uses user feedback to improve price predictions overtime.

## Installation
This project requires Python 3.6+ and the following Python libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

To run this project, download the project files and run the Notebook.

## Usage
After installing the necessary libraries, open the Notebook. You can view the code and output for each cell and run each cell individually. To run all cells at once, click Cell -> Run All in the menu.

## Features
The project consists of several components:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset to ensure it is suitable for training a model. This includes removing outliers, handling missing values, and handling duplicates.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming the raw data into a format that is more suitable for modelling. This includes encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and handling highly correlated features.
- **Model Training**: Training the machine learning model on the preprocessed dataset. This includes splitting the dataset, feature scaling, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained model. This includes using metrics and achieving a high accuracy rate.
- **Prediction**: Using the trained and evaluated model to predict new data.
- **User Interface**: Developing a simple web interface where users can input car features and receive predicted prices.
